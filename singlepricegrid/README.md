## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I mainly learned what *not* to do, as in, do not have 5 different shades of white for your font unless you want to spend all that time customizing.

I'm also pretty much convinced at this point that some of these color choices probably won't pass the AA color contrast accessibility requriement.
